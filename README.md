# Into the Odd Character Generator

A small project I'm working on to help myself learn the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework.

[Check out the live example here!](https://svelte-into-the-odd.vercel.app/)

This is absolutely a work in progress. The shortlist of things to accomplish are: 

- [ ] Style the dang thing. 
- [ ] Add buttons for testing attributes.
- [ ] Figure out a definite way to implement item lists 
  - [ ] Currently, items have three attributes: cost, damage, and name.
- [ ] Add options to player items to 
  - [ ] Remove the item
  - [ ] Sell the item back (already implemented by clicking on the item)
  - [ ] Rolling the items damage
